 a. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) previously undertook an initiative in Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 1 as part of a Department-wide, uniform planning process which uses an integrated approach to services and facility planning.
 b. This Task Order intends to follow on from that previous work to clarify assumptions that should be considered in completing master planning documents for all facilities in VISN 1 including updates to the original five Medical Center Master Plan documents completed under a previous task order.
 
 Purpose
 a. This Task Order to complete the comprehensive services and facility planning for VISN 1 will:
 i. Provide validated and adjusted workload allocations by market, sub-market, and facility using Baseline FY12 data to determine market demand for VHA, VBA, and NCA services across the VHA VISN 1 footprint. Review and update the integrated service and facility planning previously accomplished for VISN 1 to reflect updated utilization data and to confirm the viability of assumptions made during Phase 1. Update the previously completed deliverables to address workload change of more than 25% of previous projections.
 ii. Expand planning horizon to include 2017 (short term) 2022 (10-year, intermediate term) with sensitivity to 2032 (20-year, long term)
 iii. Revise assumptions for planning consistent with  Assumptions  section of this SOW. 
 iv. Provide a Health Services Delivery Plan for all Markets in VISN 1 to include a comprehensive list of capital projects for all facilities in the VISN 1 footprint to complete the transfer from current status to ideal.  These market-level plans will drive facility development and investment within each market area. Provide narrative, tabular, and graphic documents which can be used to guide the development of Major, Minor, NRM and other project types for submission and review in the new VHA Capital Asset Master Plan (CAMP) process and in the VA-level Strategic Capital Investment Plan (SCIP) process for all VHA facilities in the VISN.
 v. Complete the master planning documents for the remaining 6 medical centers consistent with the assumptions and end state and update the previously completed master plans consistent with the assumptions and the end state.  Update the previously completed Facility Master Plans to address workload change of more than 25% of previous projections.
 vi.Develop strategies and plans to identify challenging or sensitive public relations is- sues associated with the implementation of the proposed Market Plans and to propose methodologies for addressing concerns that will likely be raised by stakeholders.
 b.For this task order, the services and facility planning will include VHA, VBA and NCA facilities.",,,,,,,,,,

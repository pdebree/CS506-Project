 Scope of Work for Cohort 4 
 
 Background: Healthcare-associated infections, or HAIs, are a highly significant cause of illness and death for patients in the U.S. health care system. At any given time, HAIs affect one out of every 25 hospital inpatients. More than a million of these infections occur across our health care system every year, leading to significant patient harm and the annual loss of tens of thousands of lives, and costing billions of dollars each year. Some of the most prevalent HAIs include: surgical site infections (SSIs), Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI), Central-Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). It is estimated that CAUTIs affect approximately 250,000 hospital patients per year, and approximately 40,000 CLABSI cases occur annually with a mortality rate from 12 to 25 percent.

 This additional recording was necessitated by a post-production review of the rough cut of the animation, which revealed areas of the film that needed to be clarified with additional narration.
